The sliding maximum problem involves finding the maximum value in every subarray (or "window") of size k as the window slides over an array. Here's a brief explanation:

Given an array nums and an integer k, you need to return an array of the maximum values for each sliding window of size k.

Example:
Input: nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], k = 3
Output: [3,3,5,5,6,7]

Explanation:
Window [1,3,-1] → Maximum is 3
Window [3,-1,-3] → Maximum is 3
Window [-1,-3,5] → Maximum is 5
Window [-3,5,3] → Maximum is 5
Window [5,3,6] → Maximum is 6
Window [3,6,7] → Maximum is 7
